						<h2>Parnashala, Badrachalam</h2>
						<p>Parnasala is a small village located at a distance of 32 kilometers from the holy town Bhadrachalam 
							in the state of Telangana, India. A little glitch in reaching the village is its remote location 
							because of which makes it a little difficult to access. One can reach Parnasala only by road or 
							boats as the means of transportation.
							<br><br>
							According to the legend, the most disciplined Lord Shri Ram spent some of his fourteen years
							of exile at this place. The little stream stands as a testimony to the belief that Sita, wife
							of Lord Shri Ram, took her bath in the stream, the place is called Sita Vaagu. Every belief is
							justified one such proof is the imprints in “Radhagutta” in Parnasala. Another story accounting 
							to the history of this historical village is that Maricha Rakshas was killed by Lord Shri Ram in
							the same place when he came in disguise as a golden deer to deceive Goddess Sita.</p>

						<h2>Sabari, Badrachalam</h2>
						<p>Dhammakka, also known as Sabari was a tribal woman and a great devotee of Lord Rama.
							Overwhelmed with the amount of devotion she had for him, Rama granted her salvation.
							Hence, Sabari took the form of a River, which later joined the River Godavari before
							falling into the sea.
							<br><br>
							The Sabari River flowing in the Telangana state is one of the major tributaries of river Godavari.
							Originating from the western slopes of the Eastern Ghats in Odisha state from the Sinkaram hill
							ranges at 1370m, it forms a common boundary between Chattisgarh and Odisha and later enters into
							Telangana to merge with River Godavari.</p>
