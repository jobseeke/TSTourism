						<h2>Nagunur Fort</h2>
						
						<p>
                                               Around 30 minutes away from Vemulawada, Nagunur Fort built by the Kakatiyas is worth checking out. The fort can transport
                                               you to the small forts of Rajasthan, and like those forts, this one has a Shiva temple and a water tank on the inside. 
                                               The beams of the temple are carved with the artwork of musicians playing instruments, and the fort is said to have housed
                                               400 temples at one point of time.

                                                is the three sanctums adjacent to each other in the east, west and south directions. Inside them are Shivalingams of about
