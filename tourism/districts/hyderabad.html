						<h2>Birla Mandir, Hyderabad</h2>
						<p>Birla Mandir (Birla Temple) refers to different Hindu temples or Mandirs built by the Birla family, 
							in different cities across India, with the exception of South India, whose cities were already well 
							supplied with temples. All these temples are magnificently built, some of them in white marble or in sandstone. 
							The temples are generally located in a prominent location, carefully designed to accommodate a large number of visitors.
							The worship and discourses are well organized. The first one was built in 1939 in Delhi collectively by Ghanshyamdas Birla and his brothers, 
							as well his father. Later temples have been built by, and are managed by different branches of the family.
							<br><br>
							Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath
							Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot. The construction took 10 years and was opened in 
							1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla 
							Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which 
							are known as Birla Mandir.
