						<h2>Yadagiri gutta, Nalgonda</h2>
						<p>Yadagirigutta Temple or 'Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy Temple' is a 300 foot-high temple situated atop a hill called Yadagiri Hill.
							At the entrance of the temple, an arch named 'Vaikuntha Dwara' can be seen. 
							The main deities of the Yadagiri Temple include the silver idol of 'Lakshmi Narasimha' and 'Aandaalamma'.
							During the annual 'Brahmotsavam', the 'Divya Vimana Rathotsavam' and on the birthday of Lord Narasimha, many festivities are held at this temple.
							<br><br>
							According to legend, 'Yadava' the son of 'Rishyasringa', meditated to please 'Lord Vishnu' as he wished to see three different forms of 'Narasimha'.
							He was granted his wish and Lord Vishnu appeared in 5 different forms 'Jwala', 'Yogananda', 'Lakshmi Narasimha', 'Ugra' and 'Gandabhrunda'. 
							For this reason, the hill was named after Yadava. 
							It is believed that the ones who worship the deities at this temple for 40 days will be cured of diseases.</p>
