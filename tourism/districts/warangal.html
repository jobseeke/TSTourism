						<h2>Pakhal Lake</h2>
						
						<p>
						Around 50 km away from Warangal city is the beautiful Pakhal Lake which is spread over an area of 30 sq km.
                                                Set amidst the lush green forests and hills, the human-made lake forms a highly picturesque location.
                                                The lake also borders a wildlife sanctuary located at its shore. The chirping of birds mingled with 
                                                rejuvenating breeze and tranquillity makes it a favourite spot for picnics and nature enthusiasts.

	                                        A  Man-made lake built during the Kakatiya Dynasty by the King Ganapati Deva in 1213 AD, it was made to serve 
                                               the farmland activities. The creation of ancient times, even today, is seen performing its duty of providing 
                                                water for irrigation. Approximately 3 Lakh acres of land is surviving over its waters. Located next to the
                                                Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary, established in the year 1952 by the makers of this lake, the Pakhal Lake also 
                                               provides natural heaven to the wild animals amongst the range of low hills and a plateau with safe ambience. 
                                                  This is the reason; one even spots a wide range of species of flora and fauna near the lake.
